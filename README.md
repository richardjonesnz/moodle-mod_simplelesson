IMPORTANT
=========
Simple Lesson new version for Moodle 4.  Beta software.

NOTE: If you are using Moodle 3.5 to 3.11 this may not be the droid you are looking for.
Please use the repo marked moodle_mod_simplelesson. Apologies for any confusion.

Brief description
=================
This is hopefully a good basis for a simplified lesson module that has basic features as follows:

1.  Supports adding basic question types (and behaviours) from the question bank
2.  Consists of multimedia pages with simple hyperlinked navigation
3.  Summary lesson attempt reports for students and teacher's
4.  Grades to gradebook, essay questions require manual grading
5.  Implements GDPR privacy requests for reporting and deletion of user data
6.  Designed for Moodle 4.0

For more complex needs (timing, access restrictions, use the Lesson activity module)
For summative activities and a wider range of question types use the quiz or lesson.
