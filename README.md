IMPORTANT
=========
Simple Lesson new version for Moodle 4.  Beta software.

NOTE: If you are using Moodle 3.5 to 3.11 this may not be the droid you are looking for.
Please use the repo marked moodle_mod_simplelesson. Apologies for any confusion.

For testing only you would need to upgrade to Moodle 4 before upgrading this plugin as it uses some new features of the re-written question bank.
