IMPORTANT
=========
Simple Lesson new version for Moodle 4 ONLY.

NOTE: If you are using Moodle 3.5 to 3.11 this may not be the droid you are looking for.
Please use the repo marked moodle_mod_simplelesson. Apologies for any confusion.

To upgrade 
==========
If you have an existing installation then:

1. Upgrade to Moodle 4 and do not copy the existing plugin code to Moodle 4.
2. Install this code to moodle/mod/simplelesson.
3. If you made backups of courses/simplelessons in Moodle 3, restore them.

Your pages should be restored correctly but you will have to import the questions and add them manually.
